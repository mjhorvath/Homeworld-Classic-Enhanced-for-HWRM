Hello, again!  
  
Here you have the second map. I suppose that now I will go you giving one after another in very little time, since it only misses to polish them some details and -how not - to make some that other second -and third!- version. I sit down it; with determination I am a little obsessive compulsive when it is to Create, and when he/she enters me the inspiration, I am not happened a thing, but thousands. (I have this way my head, clear.)  
Because well, we go to the grain. Imagine that you are in your shift of rest, placidly sleeping, recovering of the drunkenness of the previous night, after having lost a heap of credits playing to the poker with a beautiful pilot of a square one of MultiGunCorvettes. ¡And suddenly it sounds the alarm! ¡MOTHERSHIP UNDER ATTACK! Some failure in the detection systems (the Mothership is very beautiful and neat in the Space, but after so many battles, it is more wornout of that than you can imagine) it has prevented to detect the arrival of an enemy outpost, and the Fleet on time (if it is that  can call this way himself to a Mothership with an only couple of ResourceCollectors - at the moment inactive - and to a single unit of Investigation that floats in the space like a tart piece) it has been taken by surprise. Get dressed as quickly as possible! (Bah! Leave the underpants and the socks.They won't be necessary you.) AND IT ASSUMES THE CONTROL AT ONCE! The Commandant of the Fleet is in one of the CryoTrays that have been taken out outside for repairs and it is impossible unhibernate him; he is more frozen than a hake. Ejem...by the way.... have they communicated what the BuildSection since it continues having problems and that it is impossible to build slighter ships that those of class Corvette? Because now you already know it. ¡Let's go! To fight and to try to save people that sleeps in the Cryos... or you will arrive to Higgara only with a cat that perhaps -for chance - is called Johnsy...If you survive.

Note:  
I have been able to check that the map is only playable against one or more AIPlayers until a point: until the moment in that the IA like such it is subdivided in their combat answers and it faces I get same, besides fighting against the human player. I don't believe that it is a defect of the map like such, but that me (at least, me personally) I don't have a XX Pentium, to 5700 Mhz and 320 Gb of RAM, but a quite modest CPU, since the same thing that happens with this map -that suddenly one comes the game below and the monitor shows me happily its configuration of Desk - it happens me with Hyperspace Arena", etc, when it gives me to believe me Luke Skywalker and to face against four five AIPlayers. I tell you this because I have already proven several times the map playing with some friends (human, clear) and it is perfectly playable and very cool. Anyway, if you want, you can prove to play the level 2, where the AI gets dizzy less, but you will run the risk that the game falls exactly in its more touching point and you have to imagine how the end would have been (including Johnsy, clear). So that you already know it: play it against human opponents. After all, it is supposed that you have already finished your training in the Simulator.  
   
Let's PLAY!
