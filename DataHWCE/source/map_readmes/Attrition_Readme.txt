About Attrition:

Attrition is meant as a Team Play battle map, played top vs. bottom. Researching, harvesting and building are all disabled by means of excluding all the ships in the initial build menu. Unfortunately, this also means no probes or scouts for those of you who like to utilize their, ummmmmm, abilities ;-) Hyperspacing is still possible, and RUs can be gathered by means of retiring ships and accumulating bounties.

Included is a 1v1, 2v2, and 3v3 map. The 2v2 and 3v3 maps have unequal allied fleets, but equal opposing teams.

Problems:

These are some problems I have had while making Attrition:

1. Accessing the build menu may cause the computer to hang. - I had this happen a few times, it seemed to happen when I accessed it through the Manager bar, although I have also had the Build menu come up sometimes (empty, of course, because I excluded all the ships). There's no real reason to go to the Build menu, but I note it here just in case.... 

2. Random Illegal Page Faults. - I don't know, maybe it doesn't like this type of map? or maybe it's just my sad old computer :-(

3. Crashes while loading, load bar is about 3/4 of the way. - This happened to me when the background had too many polygons. The background I made for Attrition has under 300 polys, but if you have this problem, try turning Backgrounds off in the Options menu.

Finally, this map does include its mission.mdr file; This apparently does not upload via WON. It should, however,  eliminate the "Autoupload" problem when playing in multiplayer for those who have downloaded the map from a map archive.



Thanks to Dylov for the Homeworld Mapmaker's Primer.
Thanks also to the Old Men Online for testing Attrition and providing their input, especially Aged-OMO, Pickled-OMO and Rogaine-OMO.
