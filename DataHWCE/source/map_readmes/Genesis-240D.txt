*********************
Imagine you are low on resources, you have lost your entire 
military fleet enabling you to escape with only your Mother 
Ship, one resource collector and your last carrier. Your 
final jump of desperation takes you to the newly forming 
star system desribed only by the number "240D".

Worst of all, you do not have the technology to construct 
Resource Controllers, meaning that you have to risk sending 
your carrier into the fury of the forming star system to 
protect your lonely collector...

And the bad news gets even worse. Your lab scientists inform 
you that the radiation from the forming star is so intense 
that Sensor Arrays will be completely useless.

Luckily for you there are small pockets of forming gas where 
planets will some day emerge that you can collect a very 
limited amount of usable resources from.

Now for the worst news of all... You are not alone! Your 
enemy has seemingly set up mining opperations in this 
inhospitable place and you have to fight for every last 
scrap that the huge system has to offer!

Countless red dots all over the near useless sensors manager, 
is that lonely dot an enemy collector or an entire Battle Group 
coming to destroy you? Did you remember to have a back-up 
probe?? "Proximity alert!" screams the computer... your 
carrier is under attack!

Genesis-240D is unlike any custom made map to date. A week 
of brainstorming by some of the most strategy oriented players 
on the Relic boards and days of programming a utility in order 
for it to be realized has culiminated in a level that defies 
the impossible and raises the bar for strategy oriented maps 
from the user community.

This map is the map of a forming solar system whose outer 
ring is over Three Million units around! The map files 
themselves are more than 10 times larger than most custom 
maps. So large, in fact, that it used to not be downloadable
over WON.

ALL THIS HAS CHANGED! With the help of Relic, several custom
map issues were identified and resolved. This means that in 
this version 1.1, you can download the map straight over WON!
You can now play the original map in all of its amazing
scope without having to spend hours trying to get a game together.
Also, the save game function now works and you can record a game
without it crashing to the desktop.

As with my previous public map, JOVIAN RINGS, this map was 
designed for those who want to play Homeworld on a little 
bit larger (or in this case, a LOT larger!) time/movement 
scale. It is an advanced map and if you are not comfortable 
with 3D movement and large scale maneuvers, you may want to 
wait on it.

In addition, this map is designed for a fairly robust gaming 
machine. I suggest a minimum of a P2-350 with 96Mb RAM and a 
12MB Voodoo2 3Dcard or better. Some playtesters have had 
good luck with P2-300's and only 64Mb RAM but YMMV. Some 
feedback has also suggested that a good defrag (with ALL 
the settings) can help speed this and other large maps.

As always, if you like this map or if you dont like this map, 
LET ME KNOW! I can only design as good a map as my own 
creativity and your feedback allow me to!

In order to play this may, unzip it into your 
SIERRA\Homeworld\Multiplayer folder. It should have seven 
folders named Genesis-240D2 to Genesis-240D8 plus this text 
file. If you have properly placed the folders, Homeworld 
will automatically recognize this map on startup when you 
select Multiplayer maps.
