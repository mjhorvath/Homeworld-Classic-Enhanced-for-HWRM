Notes for Legacy

This map is a large crown (about 200 km in diameter) with ample (I think)
resources.  Playable for all versions from 2 to 6 players.  Teams are top
vs. bottom.

Thanks to Taker and Dylov for their excellent Strand and Ring maker tools.
And a special thanks to Geritol-OMO, CatScan-OMO, Cane-OMO:au and, of course,
HotFlash-OMO for helping me play test it in one of the more fun games I've had.
As always, if you have ideas to improve this map, feel free to email me 
at aged@oldmenonline.com.  Constructive comments are always welcome.
(... but not always heeded :) )

Unzip the file into your Sierra/Homeworld/Multiplayer/ directory, making
sure that you have "Use folder names" checked in WinZip.  You should end
up with 5 folders (Legacy2, Legacy3, Legacy4, Legacy5 and Legacy6).
