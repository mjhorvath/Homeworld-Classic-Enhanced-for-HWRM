   Elite commanders come face to face over a resource rich parcel of space. 
Beware this nebula contains pockets of volatile gas and is reportedly 
the homebase for a strong force of pirates.  If these reports are true it 
will make the campaign against your foe all the more difficult.


   This map is designed with making use of some form of strategy other then 
point your fleet directly across the map at your enemy and click.

   The starting fleet for all players is : 1 Resource Collector, and 5 
Scouts, 1 Resource Controller and a lone Research Vessel.

   Resources are located in a fashion that the Z axis and 3D thinking are 
required.  Also the motherships are not on the same flat plane they are 
diagonal to each other on the Z axis as well. Four areas of the maps resources
regenerate slowly, Gas, Nebula, Dust and Asteroids are all present.
