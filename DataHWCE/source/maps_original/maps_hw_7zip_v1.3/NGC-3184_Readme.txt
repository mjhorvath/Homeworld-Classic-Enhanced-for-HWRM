Background Storyline and/or Comments:

*************

This map has been designed for a Two Teams bash for up to 8 players.

In order to play this may, unzip it into your SIERRA\Homeworld\Multiplayer folder. It should have sevenfolders named NGC-3184-2 - NGC-3184-8 plus this text file. If you have properly placed the folders, Homeworld will automatically recognize this map on startup when you select Multiplayer maps.

v1.1 changes - added support for 3, 5, and 7 players although the starting locations are uneven.

v1.2 changes - changed name slightly and trimmed the asteroid spread slightly by creating a second resource file to facilitate WON download. Also found and deleted an excel file in one of the folders adding 1.5megs to the WON download! Sheesh.
