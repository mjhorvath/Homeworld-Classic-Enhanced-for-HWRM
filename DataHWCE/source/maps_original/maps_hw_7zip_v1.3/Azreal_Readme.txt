Notes for Azreal

This map consists of a large (100km) sphere with a nebula inside that
extends through each axis (+/-).  It's named after the angel that's 
said to separate the soul from the body.  Top vs. Bottom for team games.

Getting the geometry down for the sphere took some work, but I plan to 
make an Excel spreadsheet for it to make it scalable.

If you have ideas to improve this map, feel free to email me at 
aged@oldmenonline.com.

Unzip the file into your Sierra/Homeworld/Multiplayer/ directory, making
sure that you have "Use folder names" checked in WinZip.  You should end
up with 5 folders (Azreal2, Azreal3, Azreal4, Azreal5, Azreal6).
