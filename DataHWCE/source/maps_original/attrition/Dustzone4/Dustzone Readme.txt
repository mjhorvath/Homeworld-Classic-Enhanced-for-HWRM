This is a beta, hopefully to be modified as a team map.  4 clusters 
of resources await to be taken and used within the dust of a stellar 
field.   It can be played as a 3 person ffa, 6 player team game 
(i.e. 2vs2vs2-2 players per cluster, 3vs3-ouside vs inside, or 
whatever you want) or a 6 player grand melee.



In order to play this may, unzip it into your 
SIERRA\Homeworld\Multiplayer folder. It should have 2
folders named Dustzone3 and Dustzone6 plus this text 
file. If you have properly placed the folders, Homeworld 
will automatically recognize this map on startup when you 
select Multiplayer maps.

Many thanx to Dylov and his primer!!!!!!!!
