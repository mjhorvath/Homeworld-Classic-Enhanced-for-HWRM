Description         Listen up commander.  
Description This particular area of space offers enough resources for any and all command ships to get started building sizable fleets.  However,  you will soon find yourself in a hairy mess fighting for the central resources, control of slipgates, and crystals.  You may find the layout of slipgates useful for laying ambushes, but be sure you don't become the ambushed.  Resource patterns indicate your use of slipgates and your prificiency at vertical movement will be keys to your success.  
Description
Description         Groups of heavy autoguns (luckily no dawg this time) have been detected around most slipgates and sensors show mines near some resources and slipgates so be wary.
