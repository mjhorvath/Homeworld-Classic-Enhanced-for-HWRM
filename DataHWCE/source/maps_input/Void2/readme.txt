	Ready to rumble? It'll take a scout about 10 seconds to reach your opponents Mothership from your starting position. Don't bother knocking...

About my maps

	All my maps are 2 player only. Sorry, but I can't reload a map into the mission editor [it locks up], so I have to create a map all at once an then tweak it in notepad.  If I can get this fixed I'll start creating maps for 2-? players, but until then you'll have to bear with me. Hey...at least you don't have to worry about anyone joining your 1v1 at the last second!
