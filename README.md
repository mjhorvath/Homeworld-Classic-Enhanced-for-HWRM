# Homeworld Classic Enhanced for HWRM

This mod has two readmes and a reference table:

* [HWR_HWClassicEnhanced_Readme.txt](HWR_HWClassicEnhanced_Readme.txt)
* [HWR_HWClassicMaps_Readme.txt](HWR_HWClassicMaps_Readme.txt)
* [HWR_HWClassicMaps_Reference.html](HWR_HWClassicMaps_Reference.html)

There is also a HTML reference for the maps, but you will need to download it first before you can view it:

* [HWR_HWClassicMaps_Reference.html](HWR_HWClassicMaps_Reference.html)

You will also need to download the level thumbnails from here:

Drop the thumbnails into "leveldata\multiplayer\deathmatchhwcm\".
