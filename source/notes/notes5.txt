Core design issues
	Should it still be possible to build a shipyard if hyperspacing is disabled? Which would be better gameplay? Need to keep in mind that Kushan and Taiidan don't require shipyards to build heavy cruisers, but do require motherships.
	Should I disable all capship production in "carrier only" mode for all races? This may make the lack of a shipyard for the Taiidan and Kushan less of a big deal.
	Should vanilla builds and researches be enabled and disabled when not needed? Currently the vanilla researches are but the builds are not.
	Should I modify the need for an advanced research module in the "carrier only" mode?
	The Players Patch features many additional races. Should I add support for these as well?
	Should I remove the Research and AdvancedResearch module requirements for researches when researching is disabled, or is this pointless? This is already the case for builds. It would (or maybe not?) require additional versions of affected ships.
	Should I remove the requirements for a Hyperspace module when hyperspacing is disabled? (This only involves shipyards as far as I have found.)
	Maybe need separate params for ships and build/research.

Miscellaneous
	Are base_research and res_index used for anything crucial? Can I safely get rid of them and simplify the scripts?
	Currently I am getting errors such as "Cannot overwrite function HGN_RESOURCECOLLECTOR_ResourceStart_OnSet" and "Cannot overwrite function HGN_RESOURCECOLLECTOR_ResourceStart_OnPause". This is because there is more than one version of the resource collector, and all versions "share" the same base model. To eliminate the error we could check first if the function has already been declared before declaring it again.
	There are also errors about the functions "ShowProductionSubsystems", "NoSalvageScuttle" and "UnderAttackReissueDock" which I don't know the origins of.
	The file "hgn_carrier.lua" needs to check the number of motherships but only recognizes the name of one of the motherships instead of all 16.
	The singleplayer builds need to be explicitly restricted in multiplayer.
	Taiidan and Kushan ship builds should require the related production subsystems since I may be enabling or disabling some of these subsystems in the future. I don't want them being built by mistake.
	Do Kushan and Taiidan carriers need hidden production modules too?
	Resource controllers have not had their resource drop off capabilities disabled in the ship files yet.
	Singleplayer hacks are missing from the HGN research script.
	Need to add game rule codes to TechList. Rename "types" parameter to "type" and add a "code" parameter for all "items".
	addAbility(<rShip>, "ShipHold", <bIsActive>, **<fDropoffRate>**, <iShipholdSize>, <sUnknown>, <sDockFamilyList>)

Things that I can control outside of a SHIP file
	grant or restrict build or research via gamerule scripts
	starting fleet files

Stupid pet tricks
	Subsystem and research requirements
		are the values for subsystem and research requirements case-sensistive? (note: target ship names do not appear to be case-sensitive)
		are the values listed/stored in another file somewhere?
		are they ever surrounded by parentheses?
		does the white space separating values and operators ever vary?
	Hgn res
		default.lua
			"instant" frigate tech applied to hgn_mothership and no TargetType
			can I safely change the TargetType to be AllShips instead?
			or should the default TargetType when absent always be Ship?
		default.lua
			item with TargetType AllShips and TargetName Hgn_fleet
		hyperspace_upgrades.lua
			two items with TargetType AllShips and TargetName Hgn_Mothership
		ability_upgrades.lua
			"DefenseFieldFrigateShield" tech applied to Hgn_DefenseFieldFrigate but no TargetType
		ai_properties.lua
			several items with no TargetType and blank TargetName
		ai_properties.lua
			several items with TargetType AllShips and no TargetName at all
		shipyard_upgrades.lua
			there are three types of shipyard and three properties to upgrade for each
		most files
			research modules are required to research most items
	Hgn bld
		mothership_builds.lua, carrier_builds.lua
			some modules require research module before they can be built
	Vgr res
		capitalship_upgrades_buildspeed.lua
			some research with hyperspace requirements
		capitalship_upgrades_buildspeed.lua
			two types of mothership need to be handled
		ai_properties.lua
			several items with no TargetType and blank TargetName
		ai_properties.lua
			several items with TargetType AllShips and no TargetName at all
		default.lua
			several items with no TargetType that would default to Ship
		singleplayer_hacks.lua
			several items with TargetType AllShips and no TargetName at all
	Kus res
		ai_properties.lua
			several items with TargetType AllShips and no TargetName at all
		default.lua
			item with TargetType AllShips and TargetName Hgn_fleet
		corvette_tech.lua, default.lua, fighter_tech.lua, frigate_tech.lua, supercapital_tech.lua
			several items with TargetName but no TargetType
			they should default to ship
	Kus bld
		corvette_build.lua
			there is a developer warning about keeping this file and another file synced
			I think the order in which the items appear in the build table matter to this other file
			it would be better to actually look for the desired table member by name instead of relying on a hardcoded table index
