Do these require research modules?
	vgr_c_production_corvette_car0
	vgr_c_production_corvette_car1
	vgr_c_production_fighter_car0
	vgr_c_production_fighter_car1

Need to continually check and update these when adding or removing builds or researches
	ai/default/classdef.lua
	ship/icons/shipicons.lua
	scripts/productiontimes/buildtimes.lua

Core design issue
	Should it still be possible to build a shipyard if hyperspace is disabled? Which would be better gameplay? Need to keep in mind that Kushan and Taiidan don't require shipyards to build heavy cruisers.
	Should I disable all capship production in "carrier only" mode? This may make the lack of a shipyard less of a big deal when hyperspace is turned off in the other modes.
	Should vanilla builds and researches be allowed and disabled when not needed? Currently the vanilla researches are but the builds are not.

Miscellaneous
	Are base_research and res_index used for anything crucial? Can I safely get rid of them and simplify the scripts?
	Currently I am getting errors such as "Cannot overwrite function HGN_RESOURCECOLLECTOR_ResourceStart_OnSet" and "Cannot overwrite function HGN_RESOURCECOLLECTOR_ResourceStart_OnPause". This is because there is more than one version of the resource collector, and all versions "share" the same base model. To eliminate the error we could check first if the function has already been declared before declaring it again.
	There are also errors about the functions "ShowProductionSubsystems", "NoSalvageScuttle" and "UnderAttackReissueDock" which I don't know the origins of.
	In the "MultiBuild" and "MultiResearch" functions in "techfunc.lua" I would like to parse the requirements statements for logical operators (& or |) and additional clauses. However, I discovered I cannot do much further here without the standard string library, which is unavailable.

Things that I can control outside of a SHIP file
	grant or restrict build or research via gamerule scripts
	starting fleet files

Problematic
	In the SHIP folder
		"hgn_carrier.lua" needs to check the number of motherships but only recognizes the name of one of the motherships instead of all 16

Stupid pet tricks
	Subsystem and research requirements
		are the values for subsystem and research requirements case-sensistive?
		are the values listed/stored in another file somewhere?
		are they ever surrounded by parentheses?
		does the white space separating values and operators ever vary?
	Hgn res
		default.lua
			"instant" frigate tech applied to hgn_mothership and no TargetType
			can I safely change the TargetType to be AllShips instead?
			or should the default TargetType when absent always be Ship?
		default.lua
			item with TargetType AllShips and TargetName Hgn_fleet
		hyperspace_upgrades.lua
			two items with TargetType AllShips and TargetName Hgn_Mothership
		ability_upgrades.lua
			"DefenseFieldFrigateShield" tech applied to Hgn_DefenseFieldFrigate but no TargetType
		ai_properties.lua
			several items with no TargetType and blank TargetName
		ai_properties.lua
			several items with TargetType AllShips and no TargetName at all
		shipyard_upgrades.lua
			there are three types of shipyard and three properties to upgrade for each
		most files
			research modules are required to research most items
	Hgn bld
		mothership_builds.lua, carrier_builds.lua
			some modules require research module before they can be built
	Vgr res
		capitalship_upgrades_buildspeed.lua
			some research with hyperspace requirements
