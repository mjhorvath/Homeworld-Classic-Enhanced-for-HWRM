	additional
		downgrade requirement for advanced research module to just the regular research module for the Hiigarans
		disable the advanced research module slot in the Hiigaran carrier SHIP file
		vaygr carriers require unique HOD and production subsystems when enabling this mode
		need to create two separate subsystems for shipyards and carriers so that I don't have to restrict carrier subsystems when all I want to restrict are the shipyard subsystems
	additional
		Hiigaran carrier has a disadvantage in that it has to build two different research modules versus only one for the Vaygr carrier
		it either needs another hardpoint just for the advanced module, or the requirement for the advanced research module should be removed from the list of research
		the Vaygr carrier has a disadvantage in that it has only one production harpoint versus the three slots available to the Hiigaran carrier
		the Vaygr carrier needs two additional production modules
		but in case of crate award, we want these don't we?
	additional
		should a new "CapShipProduction" research for health, speed, etc. be created just to allow carriers in carrier-only mode to upgrade themselves? maybe "CarrierProduction"?
