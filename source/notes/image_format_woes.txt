DDS dimensions must be a power of two i.e. 128 256 512 1024
TGA dimensions can be multiples of powers of two, such as 384
Letting HW2 resize the images makes thumbnails unreadable.
DDS "compressed" size seems to be the same regardless of the size of the actual image area, at least when using XnView to convert them.
Downscaling by 75% and then back up seems to produce OK results.
Only other alternative is to re-do all the thumbnails with a larger font size.
