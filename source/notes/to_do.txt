TO DO

* Make sure all five asteroids have resource latch points.
* Make sure that only the HW1C resources, clouds, etc. are being used, not the HW2C ones.
* Make sure there are no stuck collectors attached to asteroids.
* Make sure as many scripts and stats are adapted from the players patch as possible versus elsewhere.
