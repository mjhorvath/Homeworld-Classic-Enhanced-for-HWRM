Example

	{ 
		Type =					SubSystem, 
		ThingToBuild =			"Hgn_C_Module_CloakGenerator",
		RequiredResearch =		"",
		RequiredFleetSubSystems =	"Research",
		DisplayPriority =		50,
		DisplayedName =			"$7018",
		Description =			"$7019"
	},

If I create two versions of the subsystem (research and no research versions) 
will I then need multiple subsystem slots on ships to potentially build them? 
Not true?

When selecting the "map default" "start with" setting, should I switch to using 
the new ship types? How do I select the correct ones? Or, should I only use the 
default ship types instead? (E.g. Relic and Gearbox's ships.)

A lot of research upgrades are missing the "TargetType" field.
