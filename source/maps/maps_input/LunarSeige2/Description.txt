Description	LunarSeige(2)
Description Version 1.1        
Description The Hiigaran moon has been overrun by a force seeking to take control of all lunar mining operations. The lunar guard has been eliminated. The Turanic Raiders are involved, but arent the sole antagonists. There are unconfirmed reports of a rogue Kiith or a Beast infestation cooperating with the Raiders! Negotiation has failed. Some Turanic carriers that had moved in for the negiotiations have had their drive systems sabotaged by Hiigaran spies after negotiations had broken. 
Description They are to be destroyed. A large attack group has been dispatched from lunar orbit to try and prevent Hiigaran forces from retaking the moon. Each side has some Turanic raider missile corvettes (Hiigara had some captured ones available). Each side also has already set up its own proximity sensor net to prepare for the coming battle.
