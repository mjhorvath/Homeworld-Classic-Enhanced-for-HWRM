Notes for Aruna

This map is patterned after a 20 TeV on 20 TeV, proton-proton
collision event as might have happened at the Superconducting
SuperCollider (now cancelled).  However, if you think it looks
like a rose, then I guess it does.  I named the map for the Hindu
goddess of the dawn because high energy collisions like this are
supposed to approach the energy levels present at the moment of
the "Big Bang" when subatomic particles may exist freely.  The
4 and 6 player versions are intended for team play as the starting
positions are arranged with a gap and not symetrical.

Thanks to Dylov for the "Strands" tool.  This map was entirely made
with it.   A special thanks to Hot Flash OMO, Bypass OMO and 
Blacklung OMO for helping me play test it. As always, if you have 
ideas to improve this map, feel free to email me at aged@oldmenonline.com.  
Constructive comments are always welcome.  (... but not always heeded :) )

Unzip the file into your Sierra/Homeworld/Multiplayer/ directory, making
sure that you have "Use folder names" checked in WinZip.  You should end
up with 5 folders (Aruna2, Aruna3, Aruna4, Aruna5 and Aruna6).
