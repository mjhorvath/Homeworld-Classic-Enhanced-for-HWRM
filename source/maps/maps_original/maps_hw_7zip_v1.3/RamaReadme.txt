Notes for Rama

This is a 2 vs. 2 map based on the alien spacecraft from the Rama series
of books by Arthur C. Clarke.  For the purists out there, the cylinder
is actually 5 times as large as the Rama spacecraft.  The one described
in the books was just too small (10 km diameter, 50 km length for the
spacecraft vs. 50 km diameter, 250 km length for the map).

Special thanks to Remzadi(DK), FishJello and, of course, HotFlash-OMO for
helping me playtest this map.

As always, if you have ideas to improve this map, feel free to email me
at aged@oldmenonline.com.  Constructive comments are always welcome.
(... but not always heeded :) )

Unzip the file into your Sierra/Homeworld/Multiplayer/ directory, making
sure that you have "Use folder names" checked in WinZip.  You should end
up with 1 folder (Rama4).
