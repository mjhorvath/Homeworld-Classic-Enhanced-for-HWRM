Notes for Lokken

This is a symetrical map featuring 4 "arms" with randomly meandering
strands.  It's primarily meant as a 1v1 or 2v2 map, but for the 3
version, it's intended to be a host vs. 2 other players as a team.
I, initially, tried to make good 3, 5 and 6 player versions but I
was too lazy to figure out the geometry.

Thanks to DeathLorD, cptnittyret and Crash+Burn666 for help 
playtesting this map.  Also, thanks to Dylov (aka Grunter OMO) for
not allowing me to be as lazy as I wanted to be with it.  As always,
if you have ideas to improve this map, feel free to email me at 
aged@oldmenonline.com.  Constructive comments are always welcome.
(... but not always heeded :) )

Unzip the file into your Sierra/Homeworld/Multiplayer/ directory, making
sure that you have "Use folder names" checked in WinZip.  You should end
up with 3 folders (Lokken2, Lokken3 and Lokken4).
