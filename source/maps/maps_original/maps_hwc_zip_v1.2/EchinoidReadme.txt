Notes for Echinoid

This map consists of a large sphere (225km radius).  It's patterned after
a Sea Urchin and is an adaptation of the Homeworld map "Koosh".  Players
are aligned along each axis to reduce the risk of isolation associated
with random starting possitions. 

This is my first Cataclysm map.  Thanks to Beltemall for his help. If you
have ideas to improve it, feel free to email me at aged@oldmenonline.com.
Constructive criticism is always welcome.  (but not always heeded  :) )

Unzip the file into your Sierra/Cataclysm/Multiplayer/ directory, making
sure that you have "Use folder names" checked in WinZip.  You should end
up with a folder called Echinoid6.
