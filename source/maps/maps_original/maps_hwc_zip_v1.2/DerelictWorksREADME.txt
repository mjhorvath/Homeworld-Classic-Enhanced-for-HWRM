Background Storyline and/or Comments:
Some interesting derelicts occupy a large asteroid field. All threats in the area must be eliminated and the derelicts secured as they may be of value to us. No opposition may be allowed to survive lest the derelicts fall into their possession. Use caution as some of the derelicts may have active automatic defenses. There is rumor of a nearby salvaging base being set up by an unknown foe. If it is located destroy it as well. The Republican Taidan has donated crews manning Taidani ships under our command for this operation. The Kushan have donated some materials as well. 


*************

This map has been designed for 2v2 or 3v3 battle, but 1v1 is ok if you have a lot of patience, for it is a very large map.

In order to play this may, unzip it into your SIERRA\Cataclysm\Multiplayer folder. It should have 1 folder named DerelictWorks6 plus this text file. If you have properly placed the folders, Cataclysm will automatically recognize this map on startup
when you select Multiplayer maps.
