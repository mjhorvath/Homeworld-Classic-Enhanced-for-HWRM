Description         A huge map for long multiplayer games. Rich resource pockets are widely spaced around a large central nebula in a 3-Dimensional pattern. Slipgates allow for rapid access to resource concentrations. The map is modeled on the Homeworld favorite Hyperspace Arena. Thanks to Apollo for the idea.
