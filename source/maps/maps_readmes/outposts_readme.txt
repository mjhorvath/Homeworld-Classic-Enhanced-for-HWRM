Notes for Outposts

This is my first 8 player map.  It's patterned a bit after Hyperspace
Arena but a bit larger and more random, I think.  You start with a remote
resource operation (i.e., it's a long way from your mothership).

If you have ideas to improve this map, feel free to email me at 
aged@oldmenonline.com.

Unzip the file into your Sierra/Homeworld/Multiplayer/ directory, making
sure that you have "Use folder names" checked in WinZip.  You should end
up with 7 folders (Outposts2, Outposts3, Outposts4, Outposts5, Outposts6,
Outposts7, Outposts8).
