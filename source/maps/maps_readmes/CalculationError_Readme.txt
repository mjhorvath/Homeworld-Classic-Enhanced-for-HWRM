The technology is never certain; something can fail in any sophisticated system as, for example, that of Sailing. A simple sign change or the omission of a punctuation sign, any insignificant detail (perhaps a little mouse is electrocuted when gnawing a small cable, causin a little court in a circuit -because in all good ship it shoul have some bug stowaway, and not necessarily the friend of Tte. Ripley),
it can behave to a diametrically opposed result to wich we await. What would happen if when carrying out a hyperjump trying to move away from the enemy routes we got exactly the opposite and did we trip of nose with an unexpected opponent? A thing is clear: we must fight. And them to try to continue our trip in the one that, inevitably, we will always meet with the enemy again.

And... of course, the lovers of the mega-hives of sligh ships won't get angry with me this time, I suppose. although they will find difficult to get it; they will have the enemy too much near and he won't give me them time enough to build too much...  ^_^
