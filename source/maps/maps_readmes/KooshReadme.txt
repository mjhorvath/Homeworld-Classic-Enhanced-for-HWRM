Notes for Koosh

This map was made using the sphere tool Excel spreadsheet and tweaking
the resulting output to give it long, thin spikes instead of the 
normal short, wide "plates".

If you have ideas to improve this map, feel free to email me at 
aged@oldmenonline.com.

Unzip the file into your Sierra/Homeworld/Multiplayer/ directory, making
sure that you have "Use folder names" checked in WinZip.  You should end
up with 5 folders (Koosh2, Koosh3, Koosh4, Koosh5, Koosh6).
