Notes for IP Pegasi (rev. 2)

This map is patterned after a binary star in the Pegasus constellation.
In this binary, a white dwarf is consuming a larger, but less massive,
red dwarf.  The captured material is forming an accretion disc around
the white dwarf.  I've redone the map completely using the spheretool
and Dylov's strand maker.

Unzip the file into your Sierra/Homeworld/Multiplayer/ directory, making
sure that you have "Use folder names" checked in WinZip.  You should end
up with 3 folders (IPPegasi2, IPPegasi3, IPPegasi4).
