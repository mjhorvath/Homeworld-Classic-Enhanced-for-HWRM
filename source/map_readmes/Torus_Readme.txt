Notes for Torus

This map is a circular toroidal "surface" consisting of 12 large, concentric
rings made using Taker's ring tool.  There is a fairly large supply of
resources, but they are scattered about in a large space.  A special thanks 
goes out to Hot-Flash-OMO, Cat Scan-OMO and Crutch-OMO for helping me play test this map.

If you have ideas to improve this map, feel free to email me at 
aged@oldmenonline.com.

Unzip the file into your Sierra/Homeworld/Multiplayer/ directory, making
sure that you have "Use folder names" checked in WinZip.  You should end
up with 5 folders (Torus2, Torus3, Torus4, Torus5, Torus6).
