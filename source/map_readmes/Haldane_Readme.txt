This is an update of the original version of this map.
It corrects a save game problem and adjusts the balance of forces
in response to player requests.
====================

Summary:

This is a large scale map for 2-4 players, based around a planetary
ring syste.

Resource injections are off, other settings at default.  Players
start with moderate RU reserves.

Resource gathering and research are both necessary, however as the
starting forces for each player include 2 research vessels,
3 resource collectors and 1 resource controller the game develops
quickly.

There are a few crates included in the ring system to create a
little randomness in the game.
