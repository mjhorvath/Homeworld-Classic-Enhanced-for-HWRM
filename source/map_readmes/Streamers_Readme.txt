Background Storyline and/or Comments:
The rich center of the great nebula is an impressive display of swirling gas streams,
projecting outwards from the ancient supernova.  A glittering jewel well worth fighting
for, it is protected heavily by the Kadeshi.

Notes:
- Includes three versions of Streamers, "Kadeshi First", "Kadeshi Last" and "Non-Kadeshi".
- In "Kadeshi Last" the last player to join the game becomes the Kadeshi.  By default one
  AI player is included so the Kadeshi will be AI controlled.
- In "Kadeshi First" the host player becomes the Kadeshi.  This is primarily designed so
  people can try playing the Kadeshi in Skirmish-mode.
- If played by a human the Kadeshi should not be allowed to build or research
  (This rule is not enforced by the map, but is recommended to keep the game balanced)
- Attempts to save or record games seem to fail with either Kadeshi version of this map.
  I suspect problems may occur with map transfers over WON as well.
  (Just have all players download the map before playing if WON refuses to transfer it)
