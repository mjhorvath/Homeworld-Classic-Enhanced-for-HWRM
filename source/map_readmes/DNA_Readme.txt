Notes for DNA

This map will probably work best for 2,4 or 6 players.  I'm not
sure about the resource distribution for 3 and 5 players.  In
a 6 player game the third player on each side is in a position 
for "resource devotion", so a 6 player ffa probably wouldn't work
well either.  Top vs. Bottom for team games.

If you have ideas to improve this map, feel free to email me at

Unzip the file into your Sierra/Homeworld/Multiplayer/ directory, making
sure that you have "Use folder names" checked in WinZip.  You should end
up with 5 folders (Dna2, Dna3, Dna4, Dna5, Dna6).
