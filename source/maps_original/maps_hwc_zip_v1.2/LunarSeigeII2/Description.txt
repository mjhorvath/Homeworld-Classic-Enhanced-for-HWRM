Description Hiigaran forces are advancing towards moon. Hiigaran side has 4 Kushan Heavy Cruisers from Kiith S'jet(with S'jet color schemes). Lunar side has 4 stolen Heavy Cruisers, bearing Turanic paint jobs. Kiith S'jet has also sent in 30 attack bombers to aid Hiigaran assault fleet. Lunar side may have some attack bombers as well, from Taidani sympathizers. If any of the extra ships are deemed not needed, retire them. Intelligence reports state that a
Description  large deployment of autoguns has been set up between us and opposing fleet's position. Recommended that these be avoided. This map has a large starting fleet. Build support modules on the carriers right away. If you dont like the extra ships, you can easily scuttle them to instantly free up support needs, but they are part of this story line which is why they were included. I understand that some people get frustrated by lots of starting ships.
Description I love ALL the ships in the Homeworld series, and i like to give players the ability to use some ships that they wouldn't otherwise be able to use. And i happen to enjoy massive fleets :). I also like to include older ships as a tribute to Homeworld, without which Cataclysm would not have come about. Please, if lots of starting ships bother you, dont get mad, just retire them (or scuttle them for that instant satisfaction!!). Enjoy my maps!
