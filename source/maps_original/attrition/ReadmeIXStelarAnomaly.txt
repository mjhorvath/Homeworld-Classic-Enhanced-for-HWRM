IX Stelar Anomaly (2 to 8 Players)
===========================================================================

   An anomaly has been detected where the gravitational fields of 2 moons 
in this system cancel each other, resource levels are at incredible levels.
Secure the area for our people.

   This map is designed with fair team play in mind, top vs bottom works
very well in this layout,you can easily make 4 teams each with 2 players as
well. This does not mean that you can not play FFA games in this map,the 
minimum distance between each starting point is 50km which is plenty if
you rather do a FFA game.

   The starting fleet for all players is : 3 Resource Collectors, and 15 
Light Defenders.

   The Light Defender is a smaller version of the normal defender which
didnt make it into the final game, you cant build more Light Defenders you
will only have the ones you begin the game with.

INSTALLATION
===========================================================================

1- Run the self extracting zip file executable.
2- Make sure to point it to where you installed Homeworld, it points to the
   default install location "C:\Sierra\Homeworld" but if you installed it 
   to a different folder you will have to point it to the correct location.
3- You are good to go, get on-line and defend your mothership!



===========================================================================
AUTO UPLOADING IN HOMEWORLD
===========================================================================

   The Game will automatically upload the map to the clients, only the host
requires the map files, however the way homeworld maps work a map that is 
meant to be played for 2 to 4 players is actually 4 maps, one for 2 players
one for 3 players and another one for 4 players, this is why you will find
the folder names with a number at the end of it in your Multiplayer folders

   This means that if you host a map that is meant for 2 to 4 players and 
you play it with 4 players, all your clients will autodowload al of the 3
map variants, this is not a problem as each map is only 4 to 20kb in size.

   Once a clent has the map he/she will be able to host games using the new
map, this is perfect to distribute maps easily and fast.
