Colony Bound...By Alan Chavira (XxCHScrazyGUYxX@aol.com)

The background is courtesy of an actual picture taken by NGC telescope.

This is my third map, the other two were okay but not worthy of post on

Settings: For 2 to 4 PLayers.  You cannot build Attack Bombers in this 
map.  They annoy the hell out of me!  I suggest injections to allow for 
hyperspacing between carrier and mothership.
