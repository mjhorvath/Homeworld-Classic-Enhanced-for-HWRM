Notes for Sankepit

This map is shaped like a shallow basket full of snakes (nebulae).  Playable 
for all versions from 2 to 4 players.

Thanks to EvilBeast*BC*TWC, Krychek8, Moo64l, Bypass and a special thank you
to my "friends" Cat Scan, Ginko and Hot Flash for their help in testing it.
As always, if you have ideas to improve this map, feel free to email me 
at aged@oldmenonline.com.  Constructive comments are always welcome.
(... but not always heeded :) )

Unzip the file into your Sierra/Homeworld/Multiplayer/ directory, making
sure that you have "Use folder names" checked in WinZip.  You should end
up with 3 folders (Snakepit2, Snakepit3 and Snakepit4).
