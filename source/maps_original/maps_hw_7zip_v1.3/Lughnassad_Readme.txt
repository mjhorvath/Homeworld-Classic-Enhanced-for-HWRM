Background Storyline and/or Comments:

Lughnassad, (the Christian 'Lammas'), an ancient Celtic fire festival, marking the shortening days and celebration of the first harvest. The waning light heralded the coming darkness and winter.

This festival was marked by the sacrifice of the divine priest-king, sacrificed willingly on the weird-stone that the harvest might be abundant and the people might survive the winter. The priest-king's sacrifice was a reflection of the imminent death of the God Lugh.

Now, when orbital farms ring the planets of most core Industrial worlds, havesting continues all year round. Huge fields of resources are generated, providing these planets with sources of raw materials unmatched in the random asteroid belts dotted throughout the known systems. Take control of this planetary sytem and use these resources to crush your enemy!
