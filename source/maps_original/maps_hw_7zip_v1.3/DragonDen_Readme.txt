Hi, HM-Warriors!  
  
Here I give you my first map. I hope you like and that you enjoy it, since it is the fruit of several insomnia nights, tons of black tea, and almost three dozens of packs of Marlboro.  
Surely the first thing that you will wonder (mainly those that like of those superhives of Scouts) it is why I exclude the Interceptors and MissileDestroyers. It is very simple: to avoid the lag. The map for itself is quite dense of content, and while I proved it I could check that in the very nurtured battles (of small ships mainly, including the missiles rushed by the Destroyers), the game went terribly slow, to stumbles. In a principle I thought that it was a too high density of Resources, so I diminished her, that which alleviated but it didn't eradicate the problem. As me I don't usually include Derelicts in my maps (if at all a moon or a planet, not much more), the problem neither was there. Next, I also diminished the number of prepared " surprises " to the players and that improved a little bit more the thing, but not definitively. And already when I was fed up with everything, in an occasion in that I suppressed the Scouts so that the AI allowed to throw him a glance to the map in peace, flying comfortably in my ProximitySensor...¡Eureka!...the map worked of marvel. And not only that, but rather the answer of the AI was of the most interesting thing, since to the one it turns private of certain ship type, it changed tactics completely...and of course, it defeated me.  
This experience took me to experience with other maps that I had made and that I had left them forgotten (without daring to send them to any Web), because neither they were graphically beautiful, neither more interesting of playing that any other one somewhere around. So I put hands to the work and I modified them in such a way that the important thing in them was the action -the amusement -, more than the beauty or the originality of the drawing made with a Derelizer, since in fact the environment cares little when the actions to continue are basically always the same ones, without too many changes. (And this says it with all my admiration and respect for those MapMakers that make true works of art. Really.) And I eat after all, the WAR is much more complex and less more foregone, easy to drift, adjustable, etc, and less comfortable, of what many players are habituated to make, comfortably seated in front of the CPU with a cigarette in a hand and a Pepsi in the other one, and a strategy already preconceived, I thought: and if suddenly to me -for example - that I love to battle with the CloakFighters, did it happen me that I cannot use them because they are NOT AVAILABLE? ¡Horror! What can I make? How me the arrangement? I have the Enemy to less than 20000 kilometers and I don't have with me a beautiful, gigantic and wonderful cloud of CloakFighters, neither of Scouts (that are also cheap and very quick of building). Then only I have two options: to abandon the game because... in short, as I cannot build a super-fleet of CloakFighters, Interceptors and Scouts, I find Map a shit (when the truth is maybe that I am only an expert with these types of ships); or to IMPROVISE to save the ass.  
That is the War. What counts is not always the numeric superiority, but the intelligence. And if you are really a good warrior, you are good in EVERYTHING, be which are the types of weapons of those that prepare, as well as their quantity. So that that it will always be the philosophy type applied to my Maps: changes in the habitual outlines of battle, limitations and unexpected disadvantages (somewhere around I have already seen some of my TestingMaps, like IN THE DARK, so it has liked, I think), necessity to improvise and, certainly, assured amusement.  
Will there be those who like, and will there be other, more conventional that will take out the map of MultiPlayer and will send it directly to the garbage, but does it stop likes the colors they have been made, it is not this way?  
I will thank all the opinions (good and bad) that can transmit me, as well as any advice (all are useful!), to this address:  starmaker72@hotmail.com  
Good luck in the Battle!
