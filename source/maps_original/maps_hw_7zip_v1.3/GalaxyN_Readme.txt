Background Storyline and/or Comments:

The Original 'Galaxym' map was only a 2 player map with the second player starting in the centre of the map, this map has been modified to remove all the derelicts and the second player starting location. 3 new player starting positions have now been added to the cardinal points.

For up to 4 players.

Background is 'inhyperspace' by Gnon
