Jovian Rings is a battle around a gas giant's rings. There are balanced resources on this very large map and NO Hyperspacing is allowed in order to play to true immensity of space. Two comets fly by, one under and one over the rings, in order to develop the three dimensionality of this map. The most strategic points are the two forming moons as they represent the only regenerating resources on the map. Two asteroid fields amongst the rings make the final pieces of a puzzle designed to allow up to six players to battle for supremacy.

This map was designed for those who want to play Homeworld on a little bit larger time/movement scale and as such there is no hyperspacing! Yes, you can turn it on, but that really kills the resource placement balance of the map. This is a good map for non-expert players to play against multiple computer opponents as its distances sheild you a bit in order to allow you to develop a little before contact.

As always, if you like this map or if you dont like this map, LET ME KNOW! I can only design as good a map as my own creativity and your feedback allow me to!

In order to play this may, unzip it into your SIERRA\Homeworld\Multiplayer folder. It should have five folders named JovianRings2 - JovianRings6 plus this text file. If you have properly placed the folders, Homeworld will automatically recognize this map on startup when you select Multiplayer maps.
