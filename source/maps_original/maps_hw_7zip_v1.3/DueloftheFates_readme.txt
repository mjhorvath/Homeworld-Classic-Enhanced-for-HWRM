About Duel of the Fates:
	The name is the name of a song in the Star Wars Phanton Menace, the song while they're dueling (Qui-gon and Obi vs. Maul).  I chose the name just becasue it sounded cool, and it seemed to fit the theme of the senario.
	Its based on  the debate between Fleet Admiral Paktu and Admiral Riif-Sa (pages 37-39 in the Homeworld manuel) of straike craft or capital ships, which is better?  I tried to keep the sides balanced, and after some testing on WON I managed to do it.  Agains the computer, whoever the player is will almost always win, but if you can get a human opponent it provides a nice drawn out battle.  The only problem with this senario is that you have to have unit caps off, becasue of the immense numbers of fighter in Paktu's side, it won't work with unit caps on.  Origionally, I had planned on about twice the numbers in this map, but after I looked at waht I had set I realized it would be way too laggy for todays computers (if the community is still here in a few years I might make a better verson).   I tried to do the map as the two Admirals described, but I took some 'liberties' to make it a bit more fun.  I have also set it so you get 1000 RUs in the beggining for some elasticy is games, but there is nothing stopping you from adding injections or bounties (though it is meant for more chess map style of play).  A very fun map, IMO, and a good challenge over LAN or WON (only other problem being the replay value isn't terribly high).
