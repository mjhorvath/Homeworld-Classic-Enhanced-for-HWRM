 This map was developed to allow those of us who prefer cap ship battles to swarming. The location of resources and the low starting resources combined with the lack of any starting ships means you will have to define a narrow path of research. 

 This is my first map for multiplayer and it won't be the last. If you have any ideas for improvement please email me at cliff_alpha@hotmail.com.

 Have fun and I'll see you on WON.
