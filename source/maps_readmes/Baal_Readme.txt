Background Storyline and/or Comments:

The Baal System has always been a system of dark renown. Once a viable star system, earmarked for colonisation by both sides in a forgotten war, it was the site of a series of horrific battles until its star went supernova several hundred years ago costing much in lives and equipment of its unfortunate inhabitants and has been shunned ever since. 

Recent probes have discovered the supernova cloud dispersed and less dense than was previously thought possible in such a short time scale, and it has been found that the system is now a reliable source of raw materials. Its two planets, once inhabitable, but now shattered and torn, creating an asteroid belt in the void providing its own gravity well capturing passing comets and asteroids that once encircled the Baal system. 

However, this data has been compromised and it can only be assumed to have been intercepted by your enemies, if one side holds such a huge source of resources it would be disastrous for the war effort. 

Your orders; take and hold the Baal system, at all cost.

*************

This map has been designed for the longer game in mind. Optimised for a 2v2 (Top vs. Bottom) team game, with each team beginning relatively closely to prevent early rushes, allowing establishment of a working defence. It can also be set up for 2 players' (1v1) or 3 players' (1v1v1) game. 

A huge asteroid belt in the Baal system provides an abundant source of raw materials allowing each player ample opportunity to build fleets of frightening strength with which to hammer their enemies. The central belt itself provides a source of regenerating resources that if taken and held will provide a strategically advantageous supply of RU's.
