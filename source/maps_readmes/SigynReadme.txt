Notes for Sigyn's Bowl

This map is suggested by the perils of the Norse god, Loki, during his
punishment.  In the story, Loki is responsible for the death of Balder
and as punishment he is chained to 3 stones and a giant snake sits above
him dripping painful venom onto his face.  Sigyn is Loki's wife.  To 
ease some of Loki's suffering, she catches the venom in a bowl.  However,
when bowl fills she must empty it and the venom can drip onto Loki's face.
Loki's writhing in pain during these times is said to be felt as earthquakes.

The map consists of a large bowl that began life as a 100km radius sphere
of asteroids.  The top 2/3 of the sphere have been deleted to give the bowl
effect.  I've lightly filled the bowl with "venom" using another sphere
(solid this time) of dust clouds and added some crystals.  I tried adding a
meteor storm, but I just couldn't get the effect I was looking for.

If you have ideas to improve it, feel free to email me at aged@oldmenonline.com.
Constructive criticism is always welcome.  (but not always heeded  :) )

Unzip the file into your Sierra/Cataclysm/Multiplayer/ directory, making
sure that you have "Use folder names" checked in WinZip.  You should end
up with a folder called Sigyn4.
