Genesis-240C is a variation on the Genesis-240D mega-map.
This is is still VERY LARGE. It has been optimzed for play
on slower systems and over the internet. The original Genesis 
map was designed for 2-8 players, this one is for 2-6 players 
and the resources have been tuned down so as to force players 
to confront each other sooner. In addition, each palyer starts 
with several more ships, including a Carrier. As with 
Genesis-240D, this map has NO Resource Controllers, and NO 
Sensor Arrays.



Here are some of the comments that the original map has received:

"Everyone here at Relic is in awe. Great job!"
Falko - Relic Entertainment

"I think this map is destined to be a classic!"
BlackMane - playtester

"Genesis 240-D is one of the greatest maps ever released
in the Homeworld community."
Talon - Map Reviewer, Homeworld Map Archive

"...the definitive HW map"
jcoltrane - Player

"Objet d'art."
Hellhawk666 - Player, map designer



In order to play this may, unzip it into your 
SIERRA\Homeworld\Multiplayer folder. It should have five
folders named Genesis-240C2 to Genesis-240C6 plus this text 
file. If you have properly placed the folders, Homeworld 
will automatically recognize this map on startup when you 
select Multiplayer maps.
