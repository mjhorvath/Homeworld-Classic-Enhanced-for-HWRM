Summary:

This map is an attempt to recreate the feel of a large
scale naval engagement.  It is a little different from most
maps because it does not have any emphasis on resource gathering.
It is the ultimate "chess game" map so far created.

Each player begins the game with a large fleet of
capital ships and fighters.  Resources cannot be gathered,
and there are no resource injections or bounties.  However,
the default RU bonus does apply - that is, whenever a player's
stockpile of RUs is less than 400 a bonus injection
of 25 points will be received at quick, regular intervals until
the total is back up to 400.

Only strike ships can be constructed, and the ability of carriers
to build a slow, constant stream of fighters can turn the tide
of battle - don't forget to keep building fighters whenever possible!
