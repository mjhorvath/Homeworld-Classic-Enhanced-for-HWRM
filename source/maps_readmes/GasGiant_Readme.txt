Hey this is great!  A free CD from Electronics Boutique, Relic and Sierra for picking up Homeworld at EB!

We hope you really enjoy the game, and since you purchased the game at Electronics Boutique, we're pleased to give you a multiplayer bonus direct from the exceptional level designers at Relic Entertainment, Inc.  Two exclusive multiplayer maps designed for use by 2 and up to 7 players.

To access these new maps, install Homeworld out of the box and afterwards, run the hwmapsetup.exe program on this CD.  When you go to play a multiplayer map you will now notice that "Rings of Plazmodeus" and "Rumble in the Stratosphere" are now added to the different scenarios you can choose from.  "Rings" supports play from 2 to 7 players, and "Rumble" supports play from 2 to 6 players.

Since this is a free giveaway for purchasing Homeworld, it is unsupported and there is no Technical Support information for this product.  

Also, it goes without saying, but the maps are pretty worthless without the game, they require Homeworld to be installed in order to work.  That's not an issue for you, though, you just bought the game!

The main Homeworld game, of course, has full Technical Support available.  See the game's readme.txt for any other contact information about the main product.

We hope you enjoy this exclusive bonus.  Thanks for buying Homeworld.
