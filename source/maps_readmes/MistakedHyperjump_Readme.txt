Good.....  
  
this time I don't have a lot to say regarding these new maps. They are recreated versions of CALCULATION ERROR that you maybe like. At least I have passed it to me well, because making a calculation error was in fact surprised by the enemies from the less prospective address. And I found the effect so amusing that I decided not to correct the error.  
It is maps to be played by two players, directly through WON. The levels 3 that I add will take them out of the portfolio Multiplayer and to keep them in some other place, since the file on the whole passes of the 64 kb and not you download in WON. If you want a FFA with a third, you will send the files for ICQ, mail, mIRC, etc so that this it installs it directly in their CPU.  
Good luck in the Battle.
