                              About The Strike

History
v1.0-no 3-D what-so-ever.  only 2 resource patches.  the 3 and 4 player versions didn't work
v2.0-completely re-did the map.  3-D only in mission spheres, not resources. Very laggy. 
v3.0-completely re-did again, this time adding 3-D to resources, as well as missions shperes.
v3.1-shifted to resources around.
v3.2-moved where motherships were, and added missile covettes for players.
v3.4-added a few more resource pockets
v3.5-thinned some resources out
v3.6-Tried to fix 3-4 player version; didn't work ,and thinned resources again
v3.7-Took out support frigates (they were too cheap)

	This is my first attempt at a map, and v1.0 of this map, well, 
sucked.  I was origionally going to send my map to BPLlama about two weeks
 before I actually did, because after I looked it over, I realized there
 wa no point to it (the map).  There was no 3-D to speak of, the resources
 were just a few spheres in the center.  So I completely revamped it...twice.
  v3.5 isn't bad, and IMO, its pretty good.  Also, BPLlama's map, 
Debris Field, helped a lot, too.  When I re-did the map the fist time, I 
took Debris Field, and change the z-axis and take out some of the turanic
 ships, and add some resources.  I also used that map to play around with
 the variables because I didn't know what most of them did.  I made some
 really odd maps doing that.  Thanks to BPLlama for all the help and to 
Rage Against the Machine, Big Bad Vodoo Daddy, and the Cherry Poppin' 
Daddies, just because they all rock.

Strategies
	You can only use strike craft, and this makes for some interesting
 strategies.  The only cuper-capital ships you can build carriers, and they
 make a large part of the game.  Try setting your carriers for your
 offensive, such as filling one up with fighters and corvettes, then 
hyperspacing it to the enemy mothership, then launching your attack.
  They also make good task forces, send one out to the edge of the map,
 and have it build fighters/corvettes.  When you've built enough, use it to
 attack from up, or down, wherever the enemy is least likely to see it. 
 The missile corvettes you get in the begginning work to protect your
 collecter, but thats about it.  They have almost no attack power, but they
 sure do look cool.  Thier special abitlity (press 'z' and drag a box around
 what you want to attack) is pretty good against group of emeny fighters
 (scouts especially).  I have also disabled the use of gravwells, since,
 well, they almost no use at all since everyone is using strikecraft.
Kamakaze aslo plays a large role in this map, if you are outnumbered,
instead of retreating it is sometimes a good idea to kamakaze your guys to
 take out thiers before they take you out.  For more kamakaze hints, look at
 my full kamakaze guide at guidestone.com. (sorry, couldn't help but 
advertise my one article on the internet.) In the current version, I have also 
decided to tae out surpport frigates; they were just too cheap.  Wtih a few
of them guarding your mothership, a group of fighters just couln't take it out.
You can still build repair corvettes, but they count against your unit cap 
(if it is on)
Also, for the people who waited this long for my map to come out (and even those who didn't)
I have added a cool song to the 'package'
Thanks for DL my map! (email me with comments, questions, or if you just want to complain)

I also plan on making some other maps (they won't have huge text files like this one)
