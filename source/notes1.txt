	additional
		vaygr carriers require unique HOD and production subsystems when enabling this mode
		need to create separate subsystems for shipyards and carriers so that I don't have to restrict carrier subsystems

things that I can control outside of a SHIP file:
	grant or restrict build or research
	starting fleet files
